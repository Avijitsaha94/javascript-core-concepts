# Closure

## What is Closure?
A closure is a feature where an inner function
can access variables of its outer function
even after the outer function has finished execution.

## How it works
- outer() creates variable `count`
- inner() uses that variable
- inner remembers the outer scope

## Why Closure is useful
- Data privacy
- State management
- Counter functions
